                <p>I am a first-year PhD student at Harvard University in the Department of Sociology. Previously, I worked as a predoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins University. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in sociology and computer science at The Ohio State University.</p>
                <p>I am interested in the relationship between people and the structures under which they live, with an emphasis on "ordinary" people and the sociology of everday life.</p>
                <p>My past research projects have focused around culture and cognition, addresssing how people form and update their beliefs about political issues, such as racial wealth gaps and fentanyl overdose.</p>
                <p>I am interested in expanding this line of inquiry to understand not only how people form beliefs but also how these beliefs change their actions and, in turn, how these actions change the macrostructure.</p>

                        <p><strong>How do the victim's demographic characteristics and contexts of substance use impact public perceptions of a fatal overdose? </strong>Using a vignette survey experiment, I find that Americans lean on narratives of "personal choice" when assigning blame to overdose victims rather than employing traditional race, class, and gender stereotypes.</p>

                            The United States is facing a drug overdose crisis, and stigma against people who use drugs is a major roadblock to implementing solutions. Despite the public health importance of understanding and mitigating substance use stigma, prior research has focused mainly on perceptions of individuals with substance use disorders and a limited set of demographic traits. This leaves critical gaps in our understanding of stigma against fentanyl overdose decedents, who represent a much broader group, including people who use substances recreationally. This study develops a more robust understanding of these attitudes through an experimental vignette survey fielded to a national sample of American adults (n = 1432). Respondents were shown two fictional fentanyl overdose obituaries where a complex suite of decedent characteristics—including demographic traits and contexts of substance use—were randomly varied in a conjoint design. Respondents then endorsed one of the two decedents for each of several attitudinal outcomes, including blameworthiness and support for various interventions, and justified their choices in an open-ended format. Results indicate that the public assesses victims of fentanyl overdose meritocratically, making judgments based on personal history and life experience rather than traditional race, class, and gender status beliefs. While certainly a signal of progress on some fronts, this meritocratic lens conflicts with the public health model of addressing the overdose crisis and exposes the alarming persistence of explicit stigma against people who use drugs.
